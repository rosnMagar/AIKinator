# AIKinator
Akinator for Disease Detection using NN cerated for **TruHacks2024**

It is just like the online game AKinator, however, instead of guessing people or objects
we guess your diseases in a fun and educative way.

## How it works?

We have a Django backend, that runs pytorch and pandas to run the neural network. The Neural Network was trained on almost half a million scenarios for 40 different most common diseases.

The Neural Network then connects to a frontend through a restful API. The front-end is made from TypeScript and HTML with TailwindCSS to provide proper interface for users to interact.

Each question is generated by calculating a correlation map to pick the best possible question based on previous questions. We got the dataset from Kaggle, and we manipulated it to meet our needs.

## Result

At the end after all possible co-rellated questions are finished, we run the question data through a Neural Network to predict Top 3 most possible Cases the Person might have:
