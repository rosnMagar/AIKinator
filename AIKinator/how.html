                    We created AIkinator: An Akinator-like program that uses Neural Networks to predict a persons diseases based on a set of
                    symptoms provided by the user.

                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500">
                    We have a Django backend, that runs pytorch and pandas to run the neural network. 
                    The Neural Network was trained on almost half a million scenarios for 40 different most common
                    diseases.  
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500">
                    The Neural Network then connects to a frontend of TypeScript and HTML with TailwindCSS to provide proper interface
                    for users to interact.

                    Each question is generated by calculating a correlation map to pick the best possible question based on previous questions.
                    We got the dataset from Kaggle, and we manipulated it to meet our needs.
